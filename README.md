# Stream Deck Scripts

This repository contains a collection of scripts for the [Elgato Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/stream-deck) that I've written. They're run as a command like so:

```bash
bash -c "<path-to-script> <args>"
```

Or run as a shell script to manage the Stream Deck:

```bash
./<path-to-script> <args>
```
